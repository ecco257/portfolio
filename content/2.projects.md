This is a smart watch app created for the Concordia University hackathon (VII). It was created using Java in Android Studio and allows users to log how they spend their time. That data syncs to a database using Firebase, then it can be visualized on a web application with graphs and charts, showing users in detail how they spend their time and what changes they should make to use their time most efficiently.
